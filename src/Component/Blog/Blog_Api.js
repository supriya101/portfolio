      desc_one: "Everything Greeks do, they do it with perfection. Be it history, food, culture, academics, or folklore, everything has a class. Similar to this are Greek surnames that have traces of rich history, culture, and wisdom. It was not until the 15th century that Greeks started giving importance to a surname. Most ancient Greek surnames are influenced by family names and parents’ names. Most Greek last names are inherited from the paternal side, i.e., the father’s first name or the family name. Their last names can easily identify someone of Greek ancestry. Most unique Greek last names and surnames have exemplary meaning to them, and those surnames can be traced back to time and grandeur origin.",

      desc_two: "Greek names are either of Latin, Hebrew or Greek origin. Some names are original Greek words, and some have been modified. The modified ones imply the origin of the name. Popular Greek last names come with suffixes. These suffixes give the history or the origin of the place to where the family belongs. Some Greek surnames have prefixes too. These prefixes reveal the identity of the person or their origin. Greek surnames are, therefore, interesting as they speak volumes about the tradition and ancestry of the person. A surname beginning with “Kara” reveals that the person is from the East, and in Turkish “kara” means black. “Konto” the prefix means short, and “papa” means a person who is a descendant of priests.",
